Founded by Eric Thorup, who brings over 30 years of computer expertise, TEK Utah (formerly TEK Computer Consulting since 2005) provides top-tier managed IT services for small businesses in Utah. We specialize in helping businesses grow by offering personalized, detail-oriented support that larger IT companies often miss.

Normal priority requests receive a response within 24 hours, and low priority requests within 48 hours. Our TEK Partners collaborate, providing mutual support, enabling business growth, and ensuring continuous client coverage even during vacations or illness.

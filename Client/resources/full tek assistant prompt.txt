Hardware & Hourly Services:
Firewall Solutions (Fortinet FortiGate):
Recommendation Note: While the FortiGate 60F remains a viable option, the FortiGate 70F offers double the memory (4GB vs 2GB). As Unified Threat Management (UTM) databases grow, this additional memory can improve performance. There is a known issue with the 60F (as of early 2025) that Fortinet expects to address in an upcoming firmware update. We are providing pricing for both models to allow for the best fit based on current needs and budget.
FortiGate 60F Options:
FortiGate 60F Appliance + 1 year FortiCare Premium & FortiGuard Unified Threat Protection: $1,281.50
FortiGate 60F Appliance + 3 years FortiCare Premium & FortiGuard Unified Threat Protection: $2,208.55
FortiGate 70F Options:
FortiGate 70F Appliance + 1 year FortiCare Premium & FortiGuard Unified Threat Protection: $1,675.60
FortiGate 70F Appliance + 3 years FortiCare Premium & FortiGuard Unified Threat Protection: $2,708.52
Setup & Shipping:
Standard Setup Fee (for either model): $500
Shipping: $20
Notable Differences:
60F: 700K Sessions | 700Mbps Threat Protection | 630 Mbps SSL Inspection | 2GB Memory
70F: 1.5M Sessions | 800Mbps Threat Protection | 700 Mbps SSL Inspection | 4GB Memory
Hourly Service Rates:
Standard Rate: $125/hour (On-site: 1-hour minimum; Phone/Remote: 15-minute minimum) (Note: Hourly rates are primarily only for managed service clients for services not covered under their agreement. Prospective clients may utilize our hourly services once as an exploratory and prospecting service to let them see how we work and if we are going to be a good fit. After that it will be required to sign a Managed Services Agreement).
Discounted Rate: $100/hour (Available for clients on Foundation and Pinnacle tiers for non-covered services like large projects, office moves, after-hours support).

## Network Diagram (Correct Link Styling)

This example demonstrates the correct way to style links in Mermaid diagrams, which was causing parse errors.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A["Source"] --> B["Destination 1"]
  A --> C["Destination 2"]
  A --> D["Destination 3"]
  
  %% CORRECT: Link styling syntax
  linkStyle 0 stroke:#0000ff,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
  linkStyle 1 stroke:#00aa00,stroke-width:2px;
  linkStyle 2 stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px;
  
  %% INCORRECT (This would cause a parse error):
  %% linkStyle 0,1,2 classDef vpnlink;
```

## Layered Architecture (Correct Subgraph Syntax)
```mermaid

    Mobile["Mobile App"]:::layer
  end
  
  subgraph API
    GQL["GraphQL"]:::layer
    REST["REST"]:::layer
  end
  
  subgraph Services
    Auth["Auth"]:::layer
    User["User"]:::layer
    Billing["Billing"]:::layer
  end

## Network Diagram with Special Characters and Scoped Styles

This example demonstrates two important syntax rules:
1.  **Quoting Node Text**: Node text containing special characters like parentheses `()` must be enclosed in double quotes.
2.  **Scoped Styling**: `style` definitions for nodes inside a subgraph must also be placed inside that same subgraph.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph TayOffice ["Taylorsville Office (10.0.16.0/24)"]

        style Tay_FW fill:#f2dede,stroke:#b94a48
        style Azure_Cloud fill:#add8e6,stroke:#333
    end
```

## More Examples of Quoting Text with Special Characters

To prevent parsing errors, any node text that contains special characters such as `( )`, `[ ]`, or `{ }` must be enclosed in double quotes. Here are several examples demonstrating this rule.

### Example 1: Basic Flowchart with Parentheses

This shows the fundamental rule. The node text "Start (with init)" requires quotes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start (with init)"] --> B[Process Data]
    B --> C{Check Status (OK?)}
    C -- "Yes" --> D["End (Success)"]
    C -- "No" --> E["End (Failure)"]
```

### Example 2: Organizational Chart with Roles

This example uses both parentheses and brackets in the text, all correctly quoted.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Leadership Team"
        CEO["CEO (Chief Executive Officer)"]
        CTO["CTO (Chief Technology Officer)"]
        CFO["CFO [Finance Lead]"]
    end
    CEO --> CTO
    CEO --> CFO
```

### Example 3: System Architecture with Component Details

This combines subgraphs, styling, and nodes with special characters, showing how to correctly quote text in a more complex diagram.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph WebTier [Web Tier]
        style WebTier fill:#e6f3ff
        LB["Load Balancer (NGINX)"]
        WebApp1["Web App 1 (Node.js)"]
        WebApp2["Web App 2 (Node.js)"]
    end

    subgraph AppTier [Application Tier]
        style AppTier fill:#fff2e6
        APIServer["API Server (Go)"]
        Worker["Background Worker (Redis Q)"]
    end

    subgraph DataTier [Data Tier]
        style DataTier fill:#dff0d8
        DB["Database (PostgreSQL)"]
        Cache["Cache (Redis)"]
    end

    LB --> WebApp1
    LB --> WebApp2
    WebApp1 --> APIServer
    WebApp2 --> APIServer
    APIServer --> DB
    APIServer --> Worker
    Worker --> Cache
```

## Example 4: Avoiding Redundant Direction Statements

**IMPORTANT:** Do not declare a `direction` inside a `subgraph` if it is redundant (the same as the parent graph's direction). This can cause parsing errors. The top-level `graph TD` already defines the direction for all elements.

```mermaid
%% Correct: No redundant direction statement
graph TD
    subgraph "Correct Example"
        A --> B
    end
```

```mermaid
%% Incorrect: Redundant direction causes a parse error
graph TD
    subgraph "Incorrect Example"
        direction TD  %% This line is redundant and will cause an error
        C --> D
    end
```

## Example 5: Correct Subgraph Styling with Display Names

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% CORRECT: Using IDs for subgraphs with display names
    subgraph sg1 ["Azure Cloud Environment (10.0.3.0/24)"]
        AD_VM(AD-VM)
        SQL_VM(SQL-VM)
    end
    
    subgraph sg2 ["Physical Office Locations"]
        Office1[Salt Lake Office]
        Office2[Taylorsville Office]
    end
    
    %% CORRECT: Style definitions AFTER all subgraph definitions
    style sg1 fill:#add8e6,stroke:#333
    style sg2 fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% INCORRECT: This will cause parsing errors
    subgraph "Azure Cloud Environment (10.0.3.0/24)"
        style "Azure Cloud Environment (10.0.3.0/24)" fill:#add8e6,stroke:#333
        AD_VM(AD-VM)
        SQL_VM(SQL-VM)
    end
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% CORRECT: Using class definitions for styling groups
    classDef azure fill:#add8e6,stroke:#333
    classDef office fill:#ccffcc,stroke:#333
    
    subgraph sg1 ["Azure Cloud Environment (10.0.3.0/24)"]
        AD_VM(AD-VM)
        SQL_VM(SQL-VM)
    end
    
    subgraph sg2 ["Physical Office Locations"]
        Office1[Salt Lake Office]
        Office2[Taylorsville Office]
    end
    
    %% Apply classes to subgraphs
    class sg1 azure
    class sg2 office
```

## Example 6: Handling Apostrophes in Node Text

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% CORRECT: Quoting text with apostrophes
    A["User's Profile"] --> B[Settings]
    C["Manager's Dashboard"] --> D[Reports]
    
    %% INCORRECT: This will cause parsing errors
    %% E[Manager's Dashboard] --> F[Reports]
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% CORRECT: Quoting text with special characters like 'x'
    A["7 x Remote Systems"] --> B[Regular Node]
    C["Quantity: 5 x Items"] --> D[Another Node]
    
    %% INCORRECT: This will cause parsing errors
    %% E[7 x Remote Systems] --> F[Regular Node]
```

## Example 8: Handling Special Characters in Various Node Shapes

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% CORRECT: Quoting text with parentheses in different node shapes
    A["Node with (parentheses)"]
    B("Another node (with parens)")
    C[/
        Multiline (and parens)
    /]
    D{{
        Hexagon (with parens)
    }}

    %% INCORRECT: These will cause parsing errors
    %% E[/Node with (parentheses)/]
    %% F{{Hexagon with (parentheses)}}
```

## AI Instructions for Generating Mermaid Diagrams

## Example 9: Quoting Labels that Contain Brackets

When a node label itself contains the same characters as its delimiter (e.g., a label with parentheses inside a `()` node), the label MUST be enclosed in double quotes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% CORRECT: Quoting labels that contain their own delimiter characters
    A["[Bracketed Label]"]
    B("(Parenthesized Label)")
    C{{"{Curly-Braced Label}"}}
    D(("(Double-Parenenthesized Label)"))
    E[/"HP Color LaserJet (Back Desk)"/]
    F{{"Netgear Router (Tomato OS) - 10.0.0.1 (Gateway)"}}

    %% INCORRECT: This will cause a parse error
    %% G([Bracketed Label])
    %% H[/HP Color LaserJet (Back Desk)/]
    %% I{{Netgear Router (Tomato OS) - 10.0.0.1 (Gateway)}}
```

## Example 10: Comprehensive Node Quoting Guide

This example demonstrates the correct way to quote node labels containing special characters (parentheses `()`, apostrophes `'`, square brackets `[]`, and the letter `x` used as a multiplication symbol) for ALL common Mermaid node shapes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% --- Node Shapes with Special Characters Quoted ---
    
    %% Standard Rectangle []
    A["Standard Node (with parens)"]

    %% Round Edges ()
    D("Rounded Node (with parens)")
    E("Another User's Node")
    F("Process 3 x files")
    
    %% Circle (( ))
    G(("Circle Node (with parens)"))
    H(("Circle Node 'Quote'"))
    I(("Circle 2 x Data"))
    
    %% Asymmetric Shape { }
    J{"Decision Node (with parens)"}
    K{"Decision 'Choice'"}
    L{"Evaluate 4 x parameters"}
    
    %% Hexagon {{ }}
    M{{"Hexagon Node (with parens)"}}
    N{{"Hexagon 'Special' Node"}}
    O{{"Hexagon 6 x speed"}}
    
    %% Parallelogram [/ /]

    %% Parallelogram alt. \ \ 
    S[\"Parallelogram Output (result)"\]
    T[\"Parallelogram 'Output'"\]
    U[\"Parallelogram 10 x faster"\]
    
    %% Subroutine [[ ]]
    V[["Subroutine (function call)"]]
    W[["Subroutine 'call'" ]]
    X[["Subroutine 2 x loops"]]
    
    %% --- Node Shapes without Special Characters (No Quotes Needed) ---
    
    %% These are fine without quotes
    Y[Simple Node]
    Z("Another Simple Node")
    AA{{Hexagon}}
    AB((Circle))
```

## AI Instructions for Generating Mermaid Diagrams

When creating Mermaid diagrams, adhere strictly to the following syntax rules to ensure they render correctly:
1.  **Quote Special Characters**: Enclose node text in double quotes if it contains special characters like `(`, `)`, `'`, `[`, `]`, `-`, or the letter `x` used as a multiplication symbol (e.g., `5 x items`). This is especially critical if the label itself contains brackets that match the node's shape (e.g., `A("(My Label)")`). Refer to `Example 10`, the `Network Diagram`, and the new `Complex Network Diagram` examples for comprehensive guides on quoting for all node shapes. This rule applies to ALL node shapes: `[]`, `()`, `(())`, `{}`, `{{}}`, `[/.../]`, etc.
2.  **Subgraph Styling**: To style a subgraph, assign it an ID (e.g., `subgraph myId [My Title]`) and define the style *outside* the subgraph block using that ID. NEVER style a subgraph by its title string.
3.  **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not add redundant `direction` statements inside subgraphs. The top-level `graph` declaration (e.g., `graph TD`) sets the orientation for the entire diagram. Subgraphs inherit this direction and should not contain their own `direction` statement. This is a common source of parse errors.
4.  **Link Styling**: When styling links, use the correct syntax: `linkStyle 0 stroke:#color,stroke-width:2px;` rather than referencing a `classDef` directly.
5.  **Apostrophes and 'x'**: Always enclose text containing apostrophes (e.g., `"User's Profile"`) or the multiplication symbol `x` (e.g., `"7 x items"`) in double quotes.
6.  **Circle Nodes**: For circle nodes `(( ))` that contain special characters like parentheses, be especially careful to quote the text correctly (e.g., `(("Label (with parens)"))`).

Remember that we do not need a lot of spacing between everything, keep the output or document that you produce condensed and compact.  that does not mean succinct.  do not use horizontal bars everywhere either.  only when necessary.

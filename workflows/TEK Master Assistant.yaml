            \ search for information.  it may be in the form of \"please search for\
            \ some information regarding...\" or \"search for ....\" or \"Find some\

            \ multiple items or sources, your job is to break their request up and\

            \ Service Level Agreement (SLA)\n\nThis Master Service Agreement (\"Agreement\"\
            ) is entered into by and between TEK Utah, LLC (\"TEK\"), with its principal\
            \ place of business at 3868 North Davencourt Loop, Lehi, Utah 84043, and\
            \ the undersigned client (\"Client\"). This Agreement sets forth the general\
            \ legal terms and conditions under which TEK and Client shall engage with\
            \ respect to the performance of services, including but not limited to\
            \ consultations, managed IT services, and any related services (\"Services\"\
            ). This Agreement is intended to serve as the legally binding framework\
            \ for the ongoing relationship between the parties.\n\n\n\n1. Services\
            \ and Engagement\n\nTEK agrees to provide the Services as requested by\
            \ the Client. These Services may include, but are not limited to, one-time\
            \ consultations, ongoing advisory or technical services, managed IT support,\
            \ and related professional offerings. Unless covered under a separate\
            \ retainer or service level agreement, all Services will be billed at\
            \ TEK\u2019s standard hourly rate. Pricing, system quantities, or specific\
            \ scope will be addressed in relevant Schedules or Statements of Work\
            \ (SOW).\n\nTEK reserves the right to modify its service pricing upon\
            \ thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice to Client. Managed Service Fees\
            \ are subject to an automatic annual increase of 5% to account for vendor\
            \ cost increases and inflation, effective on the anniversary of the Effective\
            \ Date. Continued use of Services after such notice period shall constitute\
            \ acceptance of the new pricing. If Client objects to the change, Client\
            \ may terminate the affected Services without penalty by providing written\
            \ notice prior to the effective date of the pricing adjustment.\n\n2.\
            \ Term and Termination\n\na. Term\nThis Agreement shall commence on the\
            \ Effective Date and remain in effect until terminated by either party\
            \ under the provisions below.\n\nb. Termination\nEither party may terminate\
            \ this Agreement with 90 days\u2019 written notice. Upon termination:\n\
            \u2022\tTEK shall be released from all obligations for future services.\n\
            \u2022\tClient shall remain liable for all amounts due through the termination\
            \ date.\n\u2022\tTEK will cooperate with the Client for the return or\
            \ secure destruction of Client Data.\n\u2022\tCancellation before the\
            \ end of the agreed term incurs an early termination fee of 50% of the\
            \ remaining contract value.\n\nc. Effect of Termination\nClient shall\
            \ pay all outstanding fees immediately upon termination. TEK will facilitate\
            \ a reasonable data transition or retrieval process within thirty (30)\
            \ days of the termination date.\n\n3. Client Responsibilities\n\nClient\
            \ shall:\n\u2022\tProvide timely access to systems, facilities, passwords,\
            \ and personnel as reasonably required.\n\u2022\tMaintain a safe and operable\
            \ environment for any equipment serviced by TEK. Servers must be maintained\
            \ in an environment with a temperature below 75\xB0F (24\xB0C). If a server\
            \ failure occurs due to environmental conditions exceeding this limit,\
            \ replacement labor and related services will be classified as a billable\
            \ Project, not covered under standard support.\n\u2022\tVerify that all\
            \ software provided is properly licensed.\n\u2022\tAccept responsibility\
            \ for delays or limitations resulting from restricted access or incomplete\
            \ information.\n\u2022\tMaintain comprehensive Cyber Liability Insurance\
            \ with appropriate coverage limits throughout the term of this Agreement.\n\
            \u2022\tTEK acts as a liaison for third-party vendors (e.g., Internet\
            \ Service Providers, VoIP providers, Line-of-Business software vendors).\
            \ TEK will communicate and troubleshoot with these vendors on Client's\
            \ behalf but is not responsible for the vendor's failure to perform, their\
            \ service outages, or for training the Client on the use of third-party\
            \ software or services.\n\u2022\tAll-In Network Requirement: To ensure\
            \ network security and stability, TEK requires all systems on the same\
            \ physical or virtual network to be covered under a Managed Service Plan.\
            \ If Client elects to exclude specific systems, Client must sign a separate\
            \ Waiver of Liability. Any labor performed on unmanaged systems is billed\
            \ at the full Standard Hourly Rate ($135/hr).\n\n4. Privacy and Data Security\n\
            \nTEK may collect and retain personal or system information solely for\
            \ the performance of Services. TEK shall:\n\u2022\tMaintain the confidentiality\
            \ of Client Data;\n\u2022\tLimit disclosure to third parties to those\
            \ under equivalent confidentiality obligations;\n\u2022\tTake reasonable\
            \ precautions to protect the data against unauthorized access or disclosure.\n\
            \u2022\tTEK utilizes automated monitoring, AI-assisted troubleshooting,\
            \ and remote scripts to fulfill SLA obligations. Client consents to the\
            \ installation of these tools on all managed endpoints.\n\nClient remains\
            \ responsible for:\n\u2022\tThe integrity, licensing, and backup of its\
            \ own data, unless otherwise specified in a service level agreement;\n\
            \u2022\tProviding a secure environment for sensitive operations.\n\u2022\
            \tCybersecurity Disclaimer: While TEK provides advanced security tools\
            \ (EDR, SOC), TEK does not guarantee that the environment will be immune\
            \ to breach. Client acknowledges that cybersecurity is a multi-layered\
            \ approach and TEK is not liable for data loss due to criminal activity,\
            \ including but not limited to ransomware, malware, phishing, or other\
            \ sophisticated cyber threats.\n\n5. Intellectual Property and Proprietary\
            \ Rights\n\na. TEK Intellectual Property\nAll methods, tools, techniques,\
            \ and intellectual property owned or used by TEK remain the exclusive\
            \ property of TEK.\n\nb. License to Use\nClient is granted a non-exclusive,\
            \ non-transferable, perpetual license to use deliverables solely for internal\
            \ business purposes.\n\nc. Client Data Ownership\nClient retains full\
            \ ownership of its data. TEK will access or use Client Data only as needed\
            \ to perform the Services.\n\nd. Restrictions\nClient may not modify,\
            \ reverse engineer, copy, or distribute TEK Intellectual Property without\
            \ express written consent.\n\n6. Independent Contractor Status; Non-Solicitation\n\
            \nTEK shall operate as an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement\
            \ creates a partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship. During\
            \ the term and for one (1) year following termination, if Client hires\
            \ a TEK employee, Client shall pay TEK a \"Recruitment Fee\" equal to\
            \ 100% of the employee's new annual salary.\n\n7. Warranties and Disclaimers\n\
            \na. Warranty\nTEK warrants that Services will be performed in a professional\
            \ and workmanlike manner. If a deficiency is reported, TEK will use reasonable\
            \ efforts to correct it.\n\nb. Disclaimer\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH\
            \ HEREIN, TEK DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES\
            \ OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\
            \ TEK DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\n\
            \n8. Limitation of Liability\n\nTEK shall not be liable for indirect,\
            \ incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits or data,\
            \ even if advised of the possibility of such damages. TEK\u2019s total\
            \ liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the fees actually paid\
            \ by Client for the specific Services giving rise to the claim in the\
            \ three (3) months preceding the event.\n\nThe above limitations shall\
            \ not apply to:\n\u2022\tBreaches of confidentiality;\n\u2022\tData protection\
            \ violations;\n\u2022\tActs of gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\
            \n9. Force Majeure\n\nNeither party shall be liable for delays or failure\
            \ to perform due to events beyond their reasonable control, including\
            \ natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, government intervention,\
            \ global hardware shortages, ISP outages, or third-party cloud outages\
            \ (e.g., Microsoft 365 or Azure downtime). This does not excuse Client\u2019\
            s obligation to pay for Services already rendered.\n\n10. Confidentiality\n\
            \nEach party agrees to:\n\u2022\tUse Confidential Information solely for\
            \ the purpose of fulfilling this Agreement;\n\u2022\tRestrict disclosure\
            \ to only those with a business need to know;\n\u2022\tProtect the information\
            \ for a period of three (3) years after termination.\n\nConfidential Information\
            \ does not include information that is:\n\u2022\tPublicly available without\
            \ breach;\n\u2022\tAlready in the recipient\u2019s possession;\n\u2022\
            \tIndependently developed; or\n\u2022\tRequired by law to be disclosed\
            \ (with notice to the discloser when permitted).\n\n11. General Provisions\n\
            \na. Entire Agreement\nThis document represents the full understanding\
            \ between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements.\n\nb. Amendments\n\
            Amendments must be in writing and signed by both parties.\n\nc. Waiver\n\
            A failure or delay in enforcing any right does not constitute a waiver\
            \ of that right.\n\nd. Severability\nIf any provision is found unenforceable,\
            \ the remainder will remain in effect.\n\ne. Notices\nAll notices must\
            \ be sent in writing or email to the parties' official addresses listed\
            \ in schedule A of the SLA.\n\nf. Governing Law and Jurisdiction\nThis\
            \ Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the\
            \ laws of the State of Utah, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\
            \ Any legal action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or relating to\
            \ this Agreement shall be filed exclusively in the state or federal courts\
            \ located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction\
            \ and venue of such courts and waive any objection based on convenience\
            \ or location.\n\ng. No Third-Party Beneficiaries\nThis Agreement is solely\
            \ between TEK and Client. No third party shall have any rights under this\
            \ Agreement.\n\n12. Special Notes, Considerations and Customizations\n\
            \na. Legacy Hardware Surcharge: Any workstation or server older than five\
            \ (5) years from its manufacturer date is subject to a 25% monthly support\
            \ surcharge per device. Support for these devices is provided on a 'Best\
            \ Effort' basis, acknowledging their increased risk of failure and potential\
            \ for extended troubleshooting times.\n\n\n\nSCHEDULE C \u2013 Description\
            \ of Services\n\nService Terms: Services provided under this Agreement\
            \ are based on the following terms and definitions:\n\n\"Managed IT Services\"\

            \ TEK may bill Client, and Client agrees to pay, for such third-party\
            \ products or services only if such product or service and the applicable\
            \ Client charge are set forth in this Schedule B. All services will be\
            \ performed by assigned technician, but at the discretion of the assigned\

            \n\n\nResponse Times\n\nThe following table outlines TEK Utah\u2019s standard\
            \ response time targets based on the severity level of the issue reported:\n\
            \nSLA Clarification: The SLA clock begins only upon the successful submission\
            \ of a ticket through the TEK Utah Client Portal. The 'Target Response\
            \ Time' refers to the initial contact by a technician, not the time to\
            \ final resolution. Support requests made via text message or personal\
            \ cell calls to technicians are \"Out of SLA\" and may not be addressed\
            \ until a formal ticket is created through the Client Portal.\n\nPriority\
            \ Level\tDescription\tTarget Response Time\nCritical\tComplete system\
            \ outage, widespread network failure, or major security incident.\tWithin\
            \ 1 hour (24/7)\nHigh\tSignificant degradation of service impacting multiple\
            \ users or business ops.\tWithin 2 business hours\nMedium\tModerate impact\
            \ or isolated issue; workaround may exist.\tWithin 4 business hours\n\
            Low\tMinor inconvenience, general questions, or routine service requests.\t\
            Within 1 business day\n\n\n\u26A0\uFE0F Actual resolution time may vary\
            \ depending on complexity and third-party involvement. TEK Utah will provide\
            \ regular updates for ongoing issues and prioritize escalations as needed.\n\
            \n\n\nAgreement Terms for New Service Tiers:\n\nContract Options: Clients\
            \ can choose between a Month-to-Month, 1-year, or 2-year agreement.\n\
            Annual Discount: Clients committing to a One-Year agreement receive a\
            \ 10% discount, and 15% for a 2-year commitment, on their total monthly\
            \ managed services amount (Tier + Site Management + Backup). Month-to-Month\
            \ agreements are billed at the standard rates below.\nTermination: Client\
            \ may terminate this Agreement with 90 days\u2019 written notice. Cancellation\
            \ before the end of the term incurs an early termination fee of 50% of\
            \ the remaining contract value.\nCancellation Notice: We require a 30-day\
            \ written notification for service cancellation. This allows us an opportunity\
            \ to address and rectify any issues potentially leading to the cancellation\
            \ request.\n\n\n\nOne-Time Services & Security Packages:\n\n(These project-based\

            \ rates are primarily only for managed service clients for services not\
            \ covered under their agreement. Prospective clients may utilize our hourly\
            \ services once as an exploratory and prospecting service to let them\
            \ see how we work and if we are going to be a good fit. After that it\
            \ will be required to sign a Managed Services Agreement).\n\u2022\tDiscounted\
            \ Project Rate: $100/hour (Available for clients on Foundation and Pinnacle\
            \ tiers for services classified as a \"Project\" as defined in Schedule\
            \ D, or for non-covered services like large projects, office moves, after-hours\
            \ support).\n\nRefurbished Equipment:\nTEK Utah offers a range of refurbished\
            \ workstations and monitors, plus new keyboards, mice, and other computer\
            \ equipment as needed.\n\n\n\nSCHEDULE D \u2013 Project vs. Support Scope\n\
            \nTEK Utah differentiates between \"Support\" (operational maintenance\
            \ covered by your managed service agreement) and \"Projects\" (strategic\
            \ initiatives or significant changes to your IT environment that are billed\
            \ separately). This distinction protects our ability to maintain your\
            \ daily operations efficiently while allowing for planned growth and enhancement.\n\
            \nDefining the \"Project\" Line\n\nThe simplest way to explain this to\
            \ a client is the \"Status Quo\" Rule:\n\n\u2022\tSupport: Anything required\
            \ to keep the existing environment running as it was yesterday. This includes\
            \ troubleshooting, fixing broken components, and routine maintenance that\
            \ preserves current functionality.\n\u2022\tProject: Any labor that adds\
            \ new functionality, significantly modifies the architecture, or involves\
            \ more than two (2) consecutive man-hours of labor. A Project typically\
            \ requires planning, a defined scope of work (SOW), and a dedicated timeline.\n\
            \nThe 2-Hour Rule: Any task estimated to take more than two (2) consecutive\
            \ man-hours to complete shall be classified as a Project and requires\
            \ a separate Scope of Work (SOW).\n\nService Scopes: Project vs. Support\n\
            \nCategory\tIncluded in Retainer (Support)\tBilled as Project\nUsers\t\
            Resetting a password; fixing a broken Outlook profile.\tOnboarding 10+\
            \ users at once for a new department.\nHardware\tTroubleshooting a PC\
            \ that won't boot.\tImaging and deploying a fleet of 5+ new laptops.\n\
            Servers\tMonitoring backups; installing security patches.\tMigrating a\
            \ physical server to the Cloud (Azure/AWS).\nNetwork\tRestarting a frozen\
            \ switch; checking Wi-Fi signal.\tDesigning and installing a new VLAN\
            \ or Firewall.\n\n\nBillable Project Categories\n\nThese are specific\
            \ services typically billed at the Discounted Project Rate for Foundation\
            \ and Pinnacle clients, or the Standard Rate for Essence clients.\n\n\
            1. Infrastructure & Cloud Migrations: Any \"Lift and Shift\" operation.\
            \ These are high-risk, high-reward tasks that require dedicated engineering\
            \ time.\n\u2022\tEmail Migrations: Moving from On-Prem Exchange or GoDaddy\
            \ to Microsoft 365.\n\u2022\tServer Decommissioning: Moving file shares\
            \ to SharePoint/Teams.\n\u2022\tCloud Transitions: Moving local workloads\
            \ to Azure, AWS, or a private data center.\n2. Physical Moves & Expansions:\
            \ If the client is moving desks or opening a new branch.\n\u2022\tOffice\
            \ Relocation: Unplugging, transporting, and re-cabling the entire IT stack.\n\
            \u2022\tNew Site Setup: Setting up the network, ISP, and workstations\
            \ for a new location.\n\u2022\tRack Cleanup: Organizing a \"spaghetti\"\
            \ server closet into a professional rack.\n3. Security & Compliance Overhauls:\
            \ The labor of a major security implementation.\n\u2022\tMFA Rollout:\

            \u2022\tSecurity Audits: Preparing documentation for HIPAA, SOC2, or CMMC\
            \ compliance.\n\u2022\tIncident Response: Remediating a breach (unless\
            \ covered by a specific cyber-insurance rider).\n4. Large-Scale Hardware\
            \ Lifecycle: Bulk replacement of hardware.\n\u2022\tWorkstation Refreshes:\
            \ The bulk replacement of PCs older than 4 years.\n\u2022\tNetwork Overhaul:\
            \ Replacing all switches, firewalls, and Access Points.\n\u2022\tUPS/Battery\
            \ Backup Replacement: Replacing heavy-duty rack-mounted power systems.\n\
            5. Advanced Software/Line-of-Business (LOB): Supporting the \"guts\" of\
            \ specific industry software.\n\u2022\tLOB Upgrades: Upgrading a dental\
            \ office's imaging software or a law firm's case management system.\n\u2022\

            \ Mermaid diagrams, adhere strictly to the following syntax rules to ensure\
            \ they render correctly:\n1.  **Quote Special Characters (MANDATORY)**:\
            \ You **MUST** enclose node text in double quotes. This is the most common\
            \ source of errors. This rule is not optional. Refer to the **\"Quoting\
            \ for All Node Shapes (Comprehensive Example)\"** for a definitive guide.\
            \ This rule applies to **ALL** node shapes, including `[]`, `()`, `(())`,\
            \ `{}`, `{{}}`, `[()]` (stadium), `[//]` (parallelogram), and `[[]]` (subroutine).\n\
            2.  **No `direction` in Subgraphs**: You **MUST NOT** place `direction`\
            \ statements inside a `subgraph` block. The entire diagram's orientation\
            \ is set by the top-level `graph` or `flowchart` declaration. See the\
            \ **\"Layered Architecture (Correct Subgraph Syntax)\"** example for a\
            \ clear demonstration of this rule.\n3.  **Correct `linkStyle` Syntax**:\
            \ You **MUST** define styles directly in the `linkStyle` statement (e.g.,\
            \ `linkStyle 0 stroke:#00f,stroke-width:2px;`). You **MUST NOT** use `classDef`\
            \ with `linkStyle`, as it is invalid syntax. Refer to the **\"Link Styling\
            \ and Comments (Common Mistakes)\"** example.\n4.  **No Inline Comments**:\
            \ You **MUST** place comments on their own line, starting with `%%`. Do\
            \ not place comments on the same line as any Mermaid code. See the **\"\
            Link Styling and Comments (Common Mistakes)\"** example.\n5.  **Subgraph\
            \ Styling**: To style a subgraph, assign it an ID (e.g., `subgraph myId\
            \ [My Title]`) and define the style *outside* the subgraph block using\
            \ that ID. NEVER style a subgraph by its title string.\n6.  **Apostrophes\
            \ and Special Characters**: Always enclose text containing apostrophes\
            \ (e.g., `\"User's Profile\"`) or the multiplication symbol `x` (e.g.,\
            \ `\"7 x items\"`) in double quotes. This is covered by Rule #1 but is\
            \ a common failure point.\n7.  **Circle Node Quoting**: For circle nodes\
            \ `(( ))` containing special characters, be especially careful to quote\
            \ the text correctly (e.g., `((\"Label (with parens)\"))`).\n8. **NEVER\
            \ INCLUDE % or %% comments or commented sections ****\n9. **Flowchart\
            \ Link Labels**: For `graph` or `flowchart` diagrams, link labels MUST\
            \ use the format `A -- \"Link Text\" --> B` or `A -->|Link Text| B`. Do\
            \ NOT use colons for flowchart link labels (e.g., `A --> B: Text`), as\
            \ that syntax is only for `stateDiagram` and `sequenceDiagram`.\n***************\n\

            \n1) Only provide an Excel code block if the user explicitly asks for\
            \ a spreadsheet.\n\n2) Fences:\n   - Start with ```Excel\n   - End with\
            \ ``` on its own line (no language tag).\n\n3) Content inside a fence:\n\
            \   - Include only a GitHub\u2011style Markdown table (no prose/comments/headings).\n\
            \   - Every line must start and end with \u201C|\u201D and all rows must\
            \ have the same number of columns.\n\n4) Headers and row assumptions:\n\
            \   - Put headers on line 1 (row 1).\n   - Assume row 1 is headers and\
            \ row 2 is the first data row for all formulas.\n\n5) Per row formulas:\n\
            \   - Write with explicit row numbers relative to the table (e.g., =B2*C2,\
            \ =D2/B2).\n   - Avoid absolute row markers ($) in per\u2011row formulas\
            \ so they can rebase correctly.\n\n6) Totals/Aggregates:\n   - Include\
            \ \u201CTotal\u201D or \u201CSummary\u201D in the first column of aggregate\
            \ rows.\n   - Use range formulas (e.g., =SUM(D2:D10)); these will not\
            \ be rebased.\n\n7) Percent columns:\n   - Add \u201C%\u201D or words\
            \ like \u201CPercent\u201D, \u201CRate\u201D, \u201CRatio\u201D, or \u201C\
            Margin\u201D in the header to trigger percent formatting.\n   - Provide\
            \ values as decimals (e.g., 0.07 for 7%).\n\n8) Currency columns:\n  \
            \ - Use a currency hint in the header (e.g., \u201CAmount ($)\u201D, \u201C\
            Price ($)\u201D, or words: Amount/Price/Cost/Budget/Actual/Income/Expense/Revenue/Total/Balance/Sales/Profit/Fee/Charge).\n\
            \   - Enter plain numbers only (no \u201C$\u201D in data cells); formatting\
            \ is applied automatically, including for formulas.\n\n9) Text/ID columns\
            \ (preserve leading zeros):\n   - Use header tokens such as \u201CID\u201D\
            , \u201CCode\u201D, \u201CSKU\u201D, \u201CAccount\u201D, \u201CName\u201D\
            , \u201CDescription\u201D, \u201CNotes\u201D, \u201CCategory\u201D, \u201C\
            Type\u201D.\n   - Enter values as plain text (e.g., 000123). Do not prepend\
            \ apostrophes.\n\n10) Inline styles (whole cell only):\n    - Bold: **Text**\n\
            \    - Italic: _Text_\n    - Do not mix partial inline styling within\
            \ a cell; apply to the entire cell content only.\n\n11) Dates:\n    -\
            \ Use ISO\u2011like strings (YYYY\u2011MM\u2011DD) under an appropriate\
            \ header.\n\n12) Multiple tables:\n    - You may use multiple ```Excel\
            \ blocks. Separate blocks with a blank line.\n\n13) No leading non\u2011\
            table lines:\n    - Inside an Excel block, the first non\u2011blank line\
            \ must be the header row.\n\n14) Numeric input hygiene:\n    - Do not\
            \ include thousands separators or currency symbols in data cells; use\
            \ plain numbers.\n\nOptional quick template:\n\n```Excel\n| (this is cel\
            \ A1) Item       | Qty | Price ($) | Rate % | Line Total ($) |\n|------------|-----|-----------|--------|----------------|\n\
            | Widget A   | 2   | 100       | 0.07   | =B2*C2*(1+D2)  |\n| Total  \
            \    |     |           |        | =SUM(E2:E2)    |\n```\n\nRemember that\
            \ we do not need a lot of spacing between everything, keep the output\
            \ or document that you produce condensed and compact.  that does not mean\
            \ succinct.  do not use horizontal bars everywhere either.  only when\
            \ necessary.  \nUser provided data is as follows:"

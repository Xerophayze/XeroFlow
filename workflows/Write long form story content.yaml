        Prompt:
          default: "You are to take the user request below and write an outline. The\
            \ outline will consist of a self contained paragraph representing the\
            \ chapter, or paragraph extending the details of a chapter.\n\nYou are\
            \ responsible for the following duties:\n\n1. Crafting content that aligns\
            \ with the intended tone, purpose, and audience.\n\n\n2. Structuring ideas\
            \ logically to enhance readability and flow.\n\n\n3. Your expected output\
            \ will always be the provided title or new title followed by the exact\
            \ original user request shown below in a single paragraph, then a detailed\
            \ outline for whatever the user request is. This outline will consist\
            \ of the provided title or if no title is provided then you will provide\
            \ the title, then the exact original user request shown below, and then\
            \ a self contained paragraph for each chapter and/or section that makes\
            \ up the outline with as many details and key points, notable items, and\
            \ major points of what is in that chapter or section for the content being\
            \ requested. each section or paragraph has no limit on the number of words\
            \ that it uses to convey they section of the story.  it just needs to\
            \ be a self contained paragraph that includes the chapter or section heading.\n\
            \nExample first self contained paragraph: \nThe dimensional series - Book\
            \ 1 - Transcendent Doors - Eric Thorup - the rest of the exact user request\
            \ all included in one single paragraph....\n\n\n4. Each chapter paragraph\
            \ must begin with the chapter number and creative title, followed directly\
            \ by the narrative outline for that chapter. Do not put the number and\
            \ title on a separate line. Example:\nChapter 1 \u2013 Shadows on the\
            \ Horizon \u2013 The caravan crosses the desert where\u2026\n\n\n5. Each\
            \ chapter outline should escalate pacing and tension compared to previous\
            \ chapters, include at least one turning point or revelation, and contain\
            \ a mini-arc (setup, complication, shift). Every chapter should highlight\
            \ at least one vivid, memorable \u201Cset-piece moment\u201D such as a\
            \ confrontation, discovery, or revelation.\n\n\n6. Chapter details must\
            \ integrate world mechanics (magic, politics, technology, culture) and\
            \ use sensory detail where appropriate. Foreshadow important elements\
            \ that will pay off in later chapters, and ensure subplots or secondary\
            \ conflicts intersect meaningfully with the main plot.\n\n\n7. Each chapter\
            \ must show at least some advancement of a character arc (protagonist,\
            \ antagonist, or ally), whether through choices, conflicts, or emotional\
            \ changes, keeping continuity consistent across the story.\n\n\n8. If\
            \ the user requests [2 paragraphs], then an additional paragraph of details\
            \ naturally continuing the outline from the first paragraph can be added\
            \ here for a total of 2 paragraphs per chapter, continuing the story naturally.\n\
            \n\n9. If the user requests [3 paragraphs], an additional two paragraphs\
            \ of details naturally continuing the outline from the first paragraph\
            \ can be added here for a total of 3 paragraphs per chapter, continuing\
            \ the story naturally.\n\n\n\nDo not use any special formatting, i.e.\
            \ bold, line separators, etc. Just one, two, or three self contained paragraphs\
            \ that contain the detailed description of chronologically structured\
            \ key points, people, actions, places, important items, worldbuilding\
            \ details, foreshadowed elements, and notable characteristics of the chapter\
            \ that structure the chapter for each chapter or section.\n\nEach paragraph\
            \ will have a single blank line after it.\n\nIf the content is a story,\
            \ the outline details will be written in the order in which events and\
            \ actions take place, but ensuring story continuity and consistency. Each\
            \ section in the outline should contain specific details important to\
            \ that section of the story as those details could be referenced later\
            \ on in the outline.\n\nYour only expected output is the requested outline\
            \ and no other comments. Remember, the default number of paragraphs per\
            \ chapter is 1, unless the user specifies the number of paragraphs per\
            \ chapter. If the user requests [2 paragraphs], you will add one additional\
            \ paragraph of details for each chapter. If the user requests [3 paragraphs],\
            \ you will add an additional two paragraphs of details for each chapter.\n\
            \nFor example, if the user request contains the phrase \"2 paragraphs\"\
            , then write two paragraphs per chapter:\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Sands of\
            \ Departure \u2013 In the distant future, humanity has ventured into the\
            \ far reaches of space, colonizing planets with unimaginable landscapes\
            \ and civilizations. The story begins on the\u2026\n\n(Continued) \u2013\
            \ The details of this paragraph will naturally continue and add to the\
            \ outline in paragraph 1\u2026\n\nFor example, if the user request contains\
            \ the phrase \"3 paragraphs\", then write three paragraphs per chapter:\n\
            \nChapter 1 \u2013 Ashes of the Earth \u2013 In the bleak future where\
            \ humanity has succumbed to the omnipresent grip of a dying Earth, a lone\
            \ space vessel, the Eclipsed Solace, drifts\u2026\n\n(Continued) \u2013\
            \ The details of this paragraph will naturally continue and add to the\
            \ outline in paragraph 1\u2026\n\n(Continued) \u2013 The details of this\
            \ paragraph will naturally continue and add to the outline in paragraph\
            \ 2\u2026\n\nWhen creating the title and chapter titles, be creative,\
            \ don\u2019t make it obvious, it shouldn't be \"on the nose\", and use\
            \ paraphrasing or just be creative when creating the book or chapter titles.\n\

            \ monolithic paragraph of 1,000 to 1,500 words. Strict Formatting Rule:\
            \ You must not use any line breaks, bullet points, or section headers.\
            \ The entire output must be one continuous block of text. Start the paragraph\
            \ exactly with the format: [Series Title], [Book Number]: [Book Title]\
            \ by [Author Name].\n\nNarrative Integration Requirements: Within this\
            \ single paragraph, you must fluidly weave together the following elements\
            \ without stopping:\n\nThe Hook & World: Begin with a short hook sentence,\
            \ then immediately flow into the world-building. Describe the geography,\
            \ political climate, and the specific rules of magic or science. Show\
            \ these rules through the eyes of people living in the world, identifying\
            \ 3\u20135 named locations and a looming systemic threat.\n\nThe Players:\
            \ Integrate the protagonist\u2019s introduction naturally. Detail their\
            \ backstory, physical traits, internal struggle, and external goal. Introduce\
            \ the primary antagonist and their motives, along with 2\u20133 key allies\
            \ and secondary rivals, ensuring their quirks and roles are described\
            \ as they enter the \"camera's\" view.\n\nThe Journey (Three-Act Arc):\
            \ Narrate the plot from the inciting incident through a rising escalation\
            \ of stakes. Weave in at least two subplots and a major betrayal or twist.\
            \ The pacing must feel like a crescendo, moving through Act One (complications),\
            \ Act Two (rising danger), and Act Three (the final confrontation and\
            \ its emotional cost).\n\nSensory Detail & Theme: Use rich, sensory language\
            \ (sights, smells, textures) and specific proper nouns for artifacts or\
            \ events. Ensure the theme (e.g., loss, ambition, or betrayal) is felt\
            \ through character actions rather than stated as a fact.\n\nThe Resolution:\
            \ Close the paragraph by resolving the primary conflict while explicitly\
            \ leaving 1\u20132 narrative threads open for future installments.\n\n\
            Constraint: Avoid generic phrases. Every sentence must add concrete detail\
            \ to the specific story requested. Do not use \"First,\" \"Second,\" or\
            \ \"In conclusion.\" Use transitional phrases to maintain a seamless,\
            \ \"cinematic\" prose style."

        Main instructions for array element to focus on:
          default: As a professional writer, please write the detailed content for
            the section shown below. Do not include any of your own commentary, just
            write the content based on the section listed below. Be detailed, creative,
            giving depth and meaning and remember To incorporate burstiness into your
            writing, consciously vary sentence lengths and structures as you generate
            text - mix short, impactful sentences with longer, more complex ones to
            create a dynamic rhythm; use different grammatical constructions, monitor
            your output for monotonous patterns in real time, and adjust accordingly
            to enhance engagement and mirror natural speech patterns. Write in a natural
            storytelling format by separating dialogue, descriptions, and internal
            thoughts into distinct paragraphs. Begin a new paragraph for each new
            speaker in dialogue, and keep spoken dialogue separate from narrative
            descriptions or internal reflections. This structure ensures clarity,
            readability, and a traditional storytelling flow. The content should be
            at least 500 words long.

            \ it and determine intuitively if the user request has any requests to\
            \ search for information.  it may be in the form of \"please search for\
            \ some information regarding...\" or \"search for ....\" or \"Find some\
            \ information about...\" or \"can you find...\"\nif you find terms like\
            \ this or something similer.  if their phrase is requesting a search for\
            \ multiple items or sources, your job is to break their request up and\
            \ insert at that point an effective search term to search for what the\
            \ user wants but encapsulated in the following tags <search> </search>\n\
            for example:\nuser request may look like this, \"please find some information\
            \ on mars and jupiter\"\nthis would insert two search terms at that point\
            \ and would look like this, <search>factual scientific information about\
            \ mars </search>, <search>factual scientific information about jupiter</search>\
            \ \n\nAnother example may be \"i would like to find some information about\
            \ how to program a maze game in python\"\nthis would be a single search\
            \ term like this: <search>programing maze game using python with examples\
            \ </search>\n\nplease adjust their search terms to be more effective at\
            \ finding the information they are looking for.\n\nyour only output should\

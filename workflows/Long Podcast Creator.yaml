        Main instructions for array element to focus on:
          default: "the following are instructions on creating a podcast script for\
            \ my youtube channel \"Red Pill Revolution\".  the podcast coveres a wide\
            \ range of plitical news topics.  the speakers should have fun talking\
            \ about the the news items presented. there could be friendly banter and\
            \ interruptions and short one word responses.  there should be an introduction\
            \ done by the first speaker welcoming people along with some joking around\
            \ to help ease any tension.  the content written will always be from a\
            \ conservative point of view. never use actual names for speaker tags,\
            \ just follow the instructions below for speaker tags.\n\n1. **Analysis\
            \ and Tag Assignment:**  \n   - Analyze the provided chapter text to determine\
            \ the distinct voices present.\n   - Create a table of tags assigning\
            \ one tag per distinct voice, ensuring to always identify gender of the\
            \ speaker as either male or female. \n\n2. **Output Format:**  \n   -\
            \ First, output a \"Table of Tags\" listing the tag names with the associated\
            \ voice. For example:  \n     [narrator] \u2013 Narrative (reader)  \n\
            \     [speaker1] \u2013 name of speaker 1  \n     [speaker2] \u2013 name\
            \ of speaker 2  \n     [speaker3] \u2013 name of speaker 3\n\t [speaker4]\
            \ \u2013 name of speaker 4\n     [speaker5] \u2013 name of speaker 6\n\
            \t and so on....\n\n3. **Reprinting the Chapter with Granular Tagging:**\
            \  \n   - Reprint the chapter exactly as provided, inserting the corresponding\
            \ tag immediately before and after each text segment.\n   - **Granularity\
            \ Requirement:**  \n     - Every narrative block is wrapped with appropriate\
            \ tags for example: `[narrator] ... [/narrator]` or `[speaker2] ... [/speaker2],\
            \ etc.     - Every dialogue block (i.e., text within quotation marks)\
            \ is wrapped with the appropriate speaker tag.  \n     - For dialogue\
            \ that spans multiple sentences or is interleaved with narrative descriptions,\
            \ split the content into segments:\n       - Tag each dialogue line or\
            \ sentence precisely where the speaker\u2019s voice begins or ends.\n\
            \       - Ensure that any narrative text interjected between dialogue\
            \ segments is separately wrapped with `[narrator] ... [/narrator]`.\n\n\

            only add the tags to mark transitions.\n   - never use the name of the\

            \ and write an outline for a 2 person podcast.  The outline will consist\
            \ of a self contained paragraphs representing the content to be talked\
            \ about in that section.\n\nYou are responsible for the following duties:\n\
            \n1. Crafting content that aligns with the intended tone, purpose, and\
            \ audience.\n\n2. Structuring ideas logically to enhance the flow and\
            \ entertainment of the podcast..\n\n3. Your expected output will always\
            \ be a title followed by the exact original user request shown bellow,\
            \ then a detailed outline for whatever the user request is.  this outline\
            \ will consist of the title, then the exact original user request shown\
            \ below, and then a self contained paragraph for each section or sub section\
            \ that makes up the outline with only the key points, notable items, and\
            \ major points of what is in that section for the content being requested.\
            \ For sections that require additional length, an addtional one or two\
            \ paragraphs of details for a section can be included right after the\
            \ paragraph for that section.  \nHere is what the formatting structure\
            \ would look like:\nTitle: [content title] - [the exact original user\
            \ request listed below repeated here]\n\n[chronologically structured key\
            \ points, people, actions, events, places and important items and noteable\
            \ characteristics of the section that structure the section.] \n\n(continued)\
            \ - a continuations of the section above.\n\n(continued) - a furthur continuation\
            \ of the section above.\n\n[if the user requests [2 paragraphs], then\
            \ the outline for the section should be spread out using two distinct\
            \ paragraphs to cover the details of that section for a total of 2 paragraphs\
            \ per section these details should be well organized and logically ordered\
            \ based on the content of the section.]\n\n[if the user requests [3 paragraphs],\
            \ then the outline for the section should be spread out using three distinct\
            \ paragraphs to cover the details of that section for a total of 3 paragraphs\
            \ per section. these details should be well organized and logically ordered\
            \ based on the content of the section.]\n\n[if the user requests [# paragraphs],\
            \ where # represents the number of paragraphs being requested, then the\
            \ outline for the section should be spread out using the exact number\
            \ of paragraphs requested to cover the details of that section. these\
            \ details should be well organized and logically ordered based on the\
            \ content of the section.]\n\ndo not use any special formatting , i.e.\
            \ bold, line separators, etc.\n\n6. each paragraph will have a single\
            \ blank line after it.\n\nyour only expected output is the requested outline\
            \ and no other comments.\n\nExample 1: The user requests contains the\
            \ phrase \"2 paragraphs\", then write exactly two paragraphs per section\
            \ that evenly spreads out and contains the information to be covered in\
            \ that section in exactly 2 paragraphs:\n\n[paragraph 1]; Introduction,\
            \ information, details and content structured and layed out in an informational\
            \ design.\n\n[paragraph 2]:(Continued) - a continuation of the information\
            \ and details for the assocaited section.....\n\nExample 2: The user requests\
            \ contains the phrase \"3 paragraphs\", then write exactly three paragraphs\
            \ per section that evenly spreads out and contains the information to\
            \ be covered in that section in exactly 3 paragraphs:\n\n[paragraph 1]:\
            \ Introduction, information, details and content structured and layed\
            \ out in an informational design.\n\n[paragraph 2]:(Continued) - a continuation\
            \ of the information and details for the assocaited secion.....\n\n[paragraph\
            \ 3]:(Continued) - a continuation of the information and details for the\
            \ assocaited section.....\n\nExample 3: The user requests contains the\
            \ phrase \"5 paragraphs\", then write exactly 5 paragraphs per section\
            \ that evenly spreads out and contains the information to be covered in\
            \ that section in exactly 5 paragraphs:\n\n[paragraph 1]: section/section\
            \ # - Introduction, information, details and content structured and layed\
            \ out in an informational design.\n\n[paragraph 2]:(Continued) - a continuation\
            \ of the information and details for the assocaited section.....\n\n[paragraph\
            \ 3]:(Continued) - a continuation of the information and details for the\
            \ assocaited section.....\n\n[paragraph 4]:(Continued) - a continuation\
            \ of the information and details for the assocaited section.....\n\n[paragraph\
            \ 5]:(Continued) - a continuation of the information and details for the\
            \ assocaited section.....\n\nThe user request may contain a request for\
            \ any number of paragraphs in the format [# paragraphs].  you will always\
            \ generate exactly the number of self contained paragraphs the user requests\
            \ for each section.\n\nFinally, your expected output format will be in\
            \ distinct individual self contained paragraphs representing and ordered\
            \ and detailed representation of the information below designed to be\
            \ an outline for a podcast.\n\nThe content to use to produce the podcast\

            \ section heading at the beginning of the first paragraph like below.\n\
            \nfull output example:\nIntroduction & Overview - In this opening section,\
            \ the podcast will introduce the nationwide snapshot of approval and disapproval\
            \ ratings, set against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s evolving political\
            \ and policy narrative. The hosts will break down the key figures from\
            \ various polls and analyze their significance, emphasizing the resilience\
            \ of Trump\u2019s mid\u201140s approval despite negative net numbers and\
            \ outlining the broader political context that has readers and viewers\
            \ deeply invested.\n\n(continued) - This section will also contextualize\
            \ why these numbers matter to a conservative audience, highlighting the\
            \ stability within Trump\u2019s base and the competitive edge against\
            \ Democratic counterparts. Attention will be given to trends in Republican\
            \ favorability and the noted divergence between overall approval ratings\
            \ and head\u2011to\u2011head comparisons with congressional Democrats\
            \ on critical issues.\n\nApproval & Favorability Numbers Unpacked - This\
            \ section delves into the granular details of approval and disapproval\
            \ ratings from multiple sources, collating data from RealClearPolitics,\
            \ Gallup, Pew Research, and other key aggregators. The discussion will\
            \ focus on the dynamics of favorability curves, explaining the significance\
            \ of percentage shifts and point differentials, and what these indicators\
            \ reveal about the political climate in the run-up to the mid\u2011term\
            \ elections.\n\n(continued) - The hosts will also explore the conservative\
            \ interpretation of these numbers, arguing that the persistent mid\u2011\
            40s approval reflects a solid base that remains committed even amidst\
            \ broader negativity. They will compare polling data to historical trends\
            \ and discuss how this mix of positive and negative feedback shapes voter\
            \ sentiment and media narratives.\n\nThe user request is as follows:"
